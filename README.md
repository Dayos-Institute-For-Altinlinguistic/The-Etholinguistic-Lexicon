## About

The **Dayos Institute for Altinlinguistic Studies** is a nonprofit, volunteer-driven research initiative dedicated to documenting and developing precise single-word expressions **Altinlinguistic Tokens** that capture nuanced ethical, epistemic, and psychological states that existing language fails to name.

Founded on February 15, 2026, by researcher and entrepreneur **Momen Ghazouani**, the Institute operates on principles of openness, scholarly rigor, and accessibility, making its entire lexicon freely available to anyone seeking more precise language for moral reflection, interpersonal dialogue, and intellectual communication.

## Mission

We address a fundamental gap in human communication: moments in ethical and intellectual life where we feel something distinct, something real, yet lack the vocabulary to name it precisely. This silence represents more than linguistic inconvenience—it reflects a gap in our collective capacity for moral clarity and interpersonal understanding.

Our mission is threefold:

1. **Create a freely accessible repository** of Altinlinguistic Tokens that enhance precision in moral and epistemic discourse
2. **Establish and maintain rigorous standards** for lexical innovation, ensuring every addition is clear, genuine, and grounded in recognizable human experience
3. **Cultivate a global community** of volunteer contributors who bring diverse perspectives, disciplinary expertise, and lived wisdom to the ongoing development of this resource

## What are Altinlinguistic Tokens?

Altinlinguistic Tokens are single words designed to encapsulate complete ethical stances, cognitive positions, or interpersonal dynamics that currently require lengthy explanation. These are not invented feelings or imposed philosophical positions they document what already exists in human experience but remains unnamed.

Each token in our lexicon includes:

- **Concise definition** capturing core meaning in plain language
- **Etymology or conceptual rationale** explaining the word's form and guiding principles
- **Usage examples** demonstrating practical application across contexts
- **Submission provenance** crediting contributors and documenting review
- **Potential misuses or limitations** where relevant

## Our Principles

### Openness
Our entire process is transparent. Anyone can propose a token, review submissions, or engage with our documented lexicon. There are no hidden criteria, no gatekeeping beyond quality, and no commercial barriers.

### Rigor
We hold ourselves to high intellectual standards. Each token undergoes careful evaluation for:
- Conceptual clarity
- Practical usability
- Potential for misuse
- Genuine contribution to discourse

We do not accept vague coinages, redundant terms, or words that serve only niche academic purposes.

### Humility
We recognize that language evolves organically, and institutional efforts cannot force adoption. We offer these words as tools, not mandates. Their success depends entirely on whether people find them genuinely useful in their own lives and conversations.

## Contributing

The Dayos Institute is sustained entirely through volunteer effort. Our contributors include:

- Professional linguists
- Moral philosophers
- Educators and writers
- Everyday individuals passionate about ethical communication

### Ways to Contribute

- **Submit tokens** based on personal experience, cultural insight, or observed communicative needs
- **Review submissions** using published criteria and expertise
- **Documentation** crafting clear definitions, usage examples, and etymological notes
- **Community engagement** helping others understand and use tokens effectively

Every role is valued, and every contribution is credited.

### Review Criteria

Submissions are evaluated against these standards:

- Names something genuinely experienced but currently unnamed
- Clear definition and intuitive usage
- Avoids unnecessary complexity or obscurity
- Practically useful rather than merely clever
- Respects cultural sensitivities and avoids harmful implications

## Using the Lexicon

All tokens are freely available for:

- Personal communication and moral reflection
- Educational purposes and teaching ethical reasoning
- Academic research and linguistic study
- Creative writing and intellectual discourse

We ask only that you credit the Dayos Institute when appropriate and use these tools thoughtfully.

## Philosophy

We understand that language adoption is unpredictable and organic. Some tokens may resonate widely; others may serve small communities with specific needs; still others may remain primarily of scholarly interest. We accept all outcomes as legitimate forms of success, because our core commitment is to documentation and availability, not enforced popularity.

**If a word helps even ten people communicate more precisely about something they care about, it has justified its place in our lexicon.**

## Structure

This repository contains:

- `/lexicon` - The complete documented lexicon of Altinlinguistic Tokens
- `/submissions` - Guidelines and templates for token submission
- `/review` - Review process documentation and criteria
- `/examples` - Usage examples and case studies
- `/community` - Community guidelines and contributor recognition

## Independence

The Institute operates with complete independence:

- No paid staff
- No institutional affiliations
- No commercial partnerships
- Sustained by modest community donations

This ensures our decisions are guided solely by quality and genuine communicative need, never by external pressure or financial incentive.

## Vision

We envision Dayos as a living archive that grows organically with human needs. As societies encounter new ethical dilemmas, as technology reshapes communication, as intercultural dialogue expands, new words will be needed. We are here to facilitate that need, not to control or monopolize it.
